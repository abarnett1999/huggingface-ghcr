# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face  
Hugging Face is a company that provides an open-source library and platform for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including pre-trained models like GPT-2. 
The Hugging Face Transformers library allows easy integration and usage of various NLP models, including GPT-2, in your applications.
Learn how to create a container and package it with GitHub Actions. This repository gives you a good starting point for a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and Python code.

I have created a web application that uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it.
