# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face ðŸ¤— 
Hugging Face is a company that provides an open-source library and platform for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including pre-trained models like GPT-2. 
The Hugging Face Transformers library allows easy integration and usage of various NLP models, including GPT-2, in your applications.

As a helpful tool, GPT-2 can assist with various tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization. With its advanced capabilities, it can create human-like text, determine the emotional tone of a piece of writing, provide relevant answers to questions, and condense lengthy texts into shorter summaries. Whether for creative writing, chatbot responses, or content generation, GPT-2 is a powerful tool for enhancing productivity and efficiency.

Objective: I have created a web application that uses FastAPI with Hugging Face with pretrained GPT-2 model that is depoloyed in the AWS lambda cloud and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it.
